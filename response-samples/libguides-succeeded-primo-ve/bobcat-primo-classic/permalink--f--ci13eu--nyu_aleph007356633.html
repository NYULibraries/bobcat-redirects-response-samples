Featuring case studies and interviews from international luxury sectors and brand managers such as Burberry, Dior, Porsche, Breitling, St. Regis Hotels &amp; Resorts, and Louis Vuitton, among others, this book offers both a research and management perspective on luxury experience to professionals in the luxury sector (e.g., CEOs, brand managers, marketing and communication professionals), as well as marketing professors, students, and people eager to learn more about how to</span><!----></prm-highlight><prm-icon link-arrow="" icon-type="svg" svg-icon-set="primo-ui" icon-definition="chevron-right"><!----><md-icon ng-if="::($ctrl.iconDefinition &amp;&amp; !$ctrl.isCustom &amp;&amp; !$ctrl.isEmailMode())" md-svg-icon="primo-ui:chevron-right" role="presentation" class="md-primoExplore-theme"><svg id="chevron-right_cache54" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" y="384" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fit="" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" focusable="false">

Specifically, it offers an overview of customer experience issues and explores big five experiential strategies that can be applied by luxury houses in order to provide the best luxury experience to their customers. Themes such as quality of customer luxury experience, immersion and co-production/co-creation in luxury, creation and management, digital and immersive marketing, and innovative market research are also examined. How do consumers define luxury? Is there one luxury or several "luxuries"? What kind of luxury experiences consumers want to live? How can luxury houses design the ultimate luxury experience? More than in any other sector, luxury consumption is a response to a search for emotions, pleasure, uniqueness, consideration and greatest services. The luxury consumer wants to live luxury experiences - not just buy luxury products or services. In this way, this book presents the luxury consumption experience as a combination of symbolic meaning, subconscious processes and nonverbal cues and characterized by fantasies, feelings and fun.
