# bobcat-redirects-response-samples

Response samples generated by the [bobcat\-redirects\-sampler](https://github.com/NYULibraries/bobcat-redirects-sampler)

## Test group: libguides

This initial sampling was done in 5 batches.  Multiple runs were necessary due
the need to restart/resume after interruptions caused by network connectivity
problems.  Also, after the first full pass was completed the test case URL filter
was improved to match http as well as https URLs in the test case file(s), and
these were
sampled in pickup runs.

Normally after a run is terminated prematurely, the full sample would be run again
in "resume" mode where any test cases not already in the _index.json_ file would be
sampled again, which would have included hundreds of test cases which failed due
to timeout.
Due to tight time constraints for this initial sampling, instead of resuming
with the full list of test case paths, subsequent runs often instead used
remainder test case files, ignoring previous failed/timed-out test cases.

The response sample HTML files, failure screenshots, and _index.json_ files
were merged to appear as if a single batch or multiple batches in "resume" mode
were run.
